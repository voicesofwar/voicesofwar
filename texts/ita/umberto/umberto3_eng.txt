Barbano 6/13/1916 from rest

My dear ones,

Dear yes I can and must write you! If I didn't now, you could – really call me ungrateful and (??). I'm at rest with our – whole brigade: however it will be a short rest, because as soon as we are reconstituted we will return to the mountains to the – new (??).

The terrible moments have passed - for our Italy, and I can tell myself - with pride that a large part of it - had the grenadiers as protagonists. I, a modest grain of sand in the – great tide of our army, have the full feeling – of having done everything – my duty, of having offered the country everything I could and owed.

My superiors are happy - with me, but what is most dear to me - is that I too am satisfied with myself, and proud - proud of the highly rewarding proposal - to value.
In the esteem of colleagues - and inferiors - I have risen so high that I almost feel dizzy with glory.

Enough my dears, the mail – is leaving and I don't want the – present to be delayed and not – to bring you my good news – (I am the only one who has been at war – since May 21st without incidents – do you think it is not enough! Kisses– your Umberto.

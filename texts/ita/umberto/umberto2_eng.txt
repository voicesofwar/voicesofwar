Dear Peppino

I'm still in Catania, with 45 days of leave, of which 15 have already gone and 30 to serve. The pleasure of staying at home was - however, poisoned by the great misfortune befalling my brother-in-law Paoluio - who underwent the amputation - of his right arm. Imagine Lucy! – Today I read that your class is also called to visit. - Would you, as a university professor, be subject or would you enjoy - exemption? Also write it down – to let mom know something specific.

- I asked, (to finally give) - an outcome, I am waiting for my transfer request- to Somalia or Eritrea - but having not received an answer - I suppose with great justification - that there is a need for some recommendation from the Minister of War. Can you and (??) make one for me? It’s easy to understand that– it is not to embark (or embark). It would be ridiculous to go to Somalia to embark. But the moment is propitious because reserve officers can also go – who until recently – were excluded from it.

Also let me know about this - something: indeed, since - I'm not sure of the exact - your address I want to register - the present. – And Gemma with the children, how are they? Will your holidays still last – long?

I greet you warmly

Yours Umberto.

Ps Maybe on Tuesday the Town Hall will pay the money: at least this is what the Mayor has promised me.

Nino was destined for the Montegallo battery (???) near Messina.

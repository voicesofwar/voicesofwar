Dear Peppino, from the outposts

I let everyone read your letter in which you told me the good things that our country does to remedy the evils of war. Have you become popular at 2 Grenadiers, 7 division 8 company (twin companies) -------- in Trieste? I think it will be long months before I get there. For now the Austrians are in conditions - of superiority, because they hold the - mountains with formidable accessory defenses - (fences, trenches, mines, wolf's mouths, - floods, fires, etc…) while we - barely hold the plain (end first sheet) and some last buttresses, the lower - plains, of the Karst chain.

But Gorizia is already being occupied by - ours and I won't pass there, and Monte - nero is the key to making all the hills in the south - one by one - fall to us. Every hill is a – fortress, well-armed and well defended.

But the enthusiastic force of ours all – will win. The Austrians must be – tired, because at any moment (three unclear words) – they come to turn themselves in for – hunger and because they are fed up. We find - therefore a discouraged enemy, whose only resistance consists in the passive defense of the barbed wire etc… -

On the other hand they have a greater experience and teach us many tricks.

Many kisses to you. Name and – name

Your

Umberto

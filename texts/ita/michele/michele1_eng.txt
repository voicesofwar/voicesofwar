Dear sister Celeste I am in good health and so I hope for you and your dear husband and family. I received your dear letter on the 31st and I answer with my news saying that I am near Cittadella in the province of Padova to go on the Trentino front but I donâ€™t know the position I hope that it will be better than where I was it was very dangerous. For now I salute you with all my heart and my salutes to Luigi Bosetta and Angelo Goodbye Sincere Goodbyes a thousand kisses and salutes your brother Michele that always remembers you I hope to see you soon.

My dear Celeste i write these few words to relieve me from my great passions that I keep in my heart. Telling you that now I am on the Trentino closed in between the mountains that looking at them makes me scared the fear that youâ€™ll never see me again is my greatest pain and to leave my dear family my dear mom as well as my children wife and sister this is an infamous world that condemns so many good people to danger for the satisfaction of some evil people. To conclude with my most faithful regards with all of my heard moved regards to your dear husband and sons Goodbye Goodbye my dear Celeste receive many regards and kisses from your dear Michele.

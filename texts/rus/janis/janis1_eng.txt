Dear mother!

Every day I wait a letter from you, but it has been a long time, and no news. Recently I received the money which you had sent me, thank you. I still live in the same camp, and I am alive and healthy so far. Yesterday I had my name day and it had been a long, exhausting year in the foreign country. I was so sad, woeful and depressed. 

Your son Ivan

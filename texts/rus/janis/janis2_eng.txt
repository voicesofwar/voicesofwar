Dear mother!

For a long time I didn’t received letters from You, and I am really worried. Recently I received the money from uncle Jacob. There are no other news and I don’t know where to send letters. I still live in the same camp with the same conditions of life. It’s hard, but I’m armed with my patience. I am well. Nothing new. From brothers Nikolay and Georgiy I also haven’t any news and I don’t know where and how they live.

Your son Ivan

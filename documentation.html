                        <!-- <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2021 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p> -->

                        <p>The beginning of World War I was marked by a complex web of treaties and alliances between
                            the
                            world's major powers. It started in 1914 with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
                            of
                            Austria-Hungary, which led to a series of events that eventually led to the declaration of
                            war.
                            On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, setting off a chain reaction of
                            events
                            that quickly escalated into a full-scale global conflict. The war was fought between the
                            Central
                            Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied Powers (led
                            by
                            France, the United Kingdom, and Russia).</p>
                        <p>Our collection contains scans of five postcards, five letters, and the five pages of the
                            diary.
                            These documents were written in 1914-18 in Turkey, Italy, Austria, Ukraine, and Russia. With
                            these letters, the user could see different periods of the war and different places. Letters
                            in
                            Italian are the most numerous in our collection thanks to the work of people who gathered
                            documents from World War I in Europeana. From Turkey, we have 1 letter provided by the
                            Uludağ
                            University History Department and 1 another one from Çanakkale Kızılay Ağadere Museum.
                            Speaking
                            about the manuscripts in the Russian language, we collected three of them – two from
                            Europeana
                            Transcribathon platform, and another from Russian State Public Historical Library.</p>
                        <p>
                            We will attempt to analyse our letters with the approach defined as Distant Reading, with
                            the aid of the Gis to find and contextualise all the letters in a predefined space, we will
                            apply a sentiment analysis to find the emotions that make up our data and establish a
                            conceptual model.

                        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                        <p>As mentioned in the introduction, after the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand
                            on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, setting off a chain reaction of
                            events that quickly escalated into a full-scale global conflict. The war was fought between
                            the Central Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied
                            Powers (led by France, the United Kingdom, and Russia). Turkey joined the war on the side of
                            the Central Powers in 1914, for expansion, because it was under German influence, for
                            religious ties since the Central Powers included several Muslim states and The Ottoman
                            Empire saw itself as the protector of the Muslim world and also to counter Russia’s
                            expansion. Russia joined the war in 1914 on the side of the Allies because of a strategic
                            alliance since Germany declared war on France which obliged Russia to enter the conflict,
                            for fear of the German expansion, to counter the danger brought by the Austro-Hungarian
                            empire to the Slavic territories and for prestige and territorial expansion. Initially,
                            Italy was part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, but ultimately
                            decided to remain neutral at the outbreak of war. In 1915, Italy switched sides and joined
                            the Allied Powers after secret negotiations promised them territorial gains in exchange for
                            their involvement in the war.</p>
                        <p>
                            After a brief summary of the beginning of the conflict we will speak in general on the
                            context and the biography of each of our heroes, with the information we were able to gather
                            from the letters, from the metadata we found in Europeana and from our personal research.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hasan Ethem Efendi and Mehmet Dursun were born in the Ottoman Empire whose decision to join
                            the war was mainly influenced by the Empire’s declining power and status and with its desire
                            to re-establish itself as a major power, in 1914 they signed a secret treaty with Germany
                            which committed the Empire to join the war if Germany went to war with Russia. The conflict
                            was a disaster for the Empire since its army was ill-equipped and ill-prepared for the new
                            type of warfare that was being fought, at the end of the war its territories were reduced,
                            its economy was in ruins and its government was in disarray; this excruciating defeat caused
                            the downfall of the Empire and the rise of modern Turkey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Ottoman empire was a Sunni state and it is very evident in the content of our letters,
                            Hasan Ethem Efendi was a martyr teacher and his letter is filled with religious content,
                            there is even a prayer inside his letter which shows the importance that religion played in
                            the empire, as mentioned before the Empire saw itself as the guardians of Islamic faith and
                            culture and used religion to justify their rule and to maintain social order. The empire was
                            also a multi-ethnic and multi religious state and adopted a policy of religious tolerance in
                            order to maintain social stability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have a bit more information on Mehmet Dursun who was a Lieutenant at the battle of
                            Çanakkale where he lost his arm due to an enemy artillery shell. The battle is one of the
                            important victories for the Ottoman Empire as it shaped its future years awakening the basis
                            for the Turkish War of independence and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey with
                            Mustafa Kemal Atatürk a commander at Gallipoli and the future founder and president of the
                            Republic.

                            Janis Farts and Ivan Vasilievich Kucherenko were born in the Russian Empire that joined the
                            war as part of the Allied Powers along with France, Britain and later the USA, the empire
                            had many political and economic interests and also had the military capabilities to endure a
                            conflict. The Russian empire was initially reluctant to join the war in 1914 as it was
                            undergoing a period of political and economic turmoil as the country was devastated by high
                            levels of poverty and inflation which only got worse with the beginning of the war, the
                            government was seen as corrupt and inefficient, and the workers demanded more rights and
                            representations. The morale of the people was really high at the beginning as we can see in
                            the letter of Perekop Ivan Kucherenko a Senior non-commissioned Intelligence officer from
                            Ukraine where the people were enthusiastic about the mobilisation to get the Germans out of
                            their land; most of the people were peasants who were sold the lie of an easy victory. The
                            Russian military faced many setbacks on the battlefield which spread much disillusionment
                            with the leadership of the Army and the Government. Janis Farts was one of the soldiers from
                            Latvia, a teacher before the war, who was wounded in Galicia and taken as a war prisoner by
                            the Austro Hungarians in Austria and was able to return home after the end of the war.

                            All of these factors contributed to the political turmoil in Russia setting the stage for
                            the Russian Revolution of 1917 and bringing the end of the Tsardom and the beginning of the
                            Soviet Union.

                            Umberto Lombardo Radice and Michele Villa were born in the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom was
                            part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria Hungary but when the war broke out it
                            decided to remain neutral as it was obliged to support its allies only for defensive
                            reasons. The Kingdom, though, was interested in gaining the territories that were considered
                            rightfully Italian: The South Tyrol and Trieste which were under Austrian Rule. It also saw
                            the war as an opportunity to improve its military capabilities and to gain prestige on the
                            world stage. In 1915 Italy signed the Treaty of London switching sides in exchange for
                            territorial concessions of the aforementioned regions. After a brief spike in morale the war
                            slightly shifted towards the Austrian side as the Italian military was plagued by poor
                            logistics and poorly equipped troops. This affected the whole country which underwent a
                            great recession. One of the main reasons for the initial defeats on the Austrian Front was
                            due to Poor leadership as many officers were not prepared to lead and direct the troops, in
                            the High command there was the idea that to have a successful attack you just needed to send
                            more men until the point was captured. Michele Villa was one of the soldiers sent to the
                            Trentino front talks in his letter about how this whole conflict seemed unjust and it sent
                            for no reason men to die, on the Mountains of Trentino is where he will be sent to death.
                            Umberto Lombardo Radice who joined the war at its declaration and fought at the Carsic
                            Border, shows another side of the war, the officer side where the whole conflict seemed like
                            a grand adventure. In the end all of these factors and the inefficiencies of the Italian
                            Military made it difficult for Italy to play a decisive role in the conflict, this changed
                            with a change in the High Ranks of the Italian Army which brought the Victory on the Isonzo
                            Front and the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

                        <p>First step to digitise our texts was their transcription. It helped us in creating searchable
                            text databases and facilitated the extraction of metadata, which is essential for organising
                            digital scholarly editions. Also, it aims one of the main goals of the digital scholarly
                            editing – exchanging data about cultural heritage. We have transcribed and translated all of
                            the letters into Italian, Russian, and Turkish, so that they are accessible to a wider
                            audience than original texts.</p>
                        <p>The transcription process involved careful consideration of the historical context and the
                            language conventions of the time. Our aim was to maintain the integrity and authenticity of
                            the original text while ensuring its readability for contemporary readers. We desired to
                            preserve the unique linguistic features, dialects, and stylistic elements present in the
                            original text, because these elements provide crucial insights into the historical period
                            and the cultural context of the document.
                        </p>
                        <p>We focused primarily on accurately representing the text's words, sentences, and overall
                            structure to provide a clear and accessible rendition of the content. Also, we used original
                            punctuation and formatting to preserve emotional context. </p>

                    <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available

                        show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep
                        the
                        demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
